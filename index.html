    (function() {
        var game = new Phaser.Game(1024, 704, Phaser.AUTO, "game");
        
        game.state.add("boot", boot);
        game.state.add("main", main);
        
        game.state.start("boot");
    })(); //why is there a (); at the end and also why is the whole function wrapped in brackets?

    /*
        this is what we call a self executing function. What it does is setup a private "scope" so that anything within does not get dumped into global!
        e.g.
        ---
        (function() {
            var helloIamLocal = 123;

            function helloIAmALocalFunction() {
                alert('hello');
            }

            helloIAmALocalFunction();
        })();

        //if i try and call helloIAmALocalFunction() here, it wont work!
        ---

        you can see here in this example that i am defining a local function and variable to use in the scope, and only in that scope. It works by calling an anonymous function.
        Or in english, its creating an "inline" function, and then immediately calling it. After that the function is not accessible to call. Sometimes people return an object
        from the function like so:

        ---
        var myThing = (function() {
            //private function
            function superSecretFunction() {
                alert('blah');
            }

            //public function
            function doUpdate() {
            	superSecretFunction();
            }

            //ok lets return an object that gives us a way to call inside this private scope!
            return {
                update: doUpdate,
            }
        })();

        //ok lets call that function
        myThing.update();
        ---

        you can see in the example above we have a private function superSecretFunction(). This is invisible to the outside world. Only within that funky (function() { })() can call it!
        this is useful if you want to create a complicated module/actor/character that has tons of helper functions and misc code, but you only have a few things you want to make
        available publiclly. E.g. when you call character.update() it in turn calls the updatePhysics() updateAnimation() updateHealth() functions private to itself!

        This method of doing things is quite common for older javascript as there had not yet been invented a way to modularise code. With stuff like the new import/export stuff I mentioned,
        you no longer have to wrap your code in these scopes as a javascript loaded into your page via "import" is considered to be private. The way you expose stuff publicly (like the example above)
        is by writing your export definitions in that particular file. Its worth a read: http://javascript.tutorialhorizon.com/2015/06/23/es6-modules-examples/

        But saying all of that, it is not 100% required to wrap in scopes. If you choose, you can just do everything in global scope. Just bare in mind that this gets messy as your project gets bigger!
